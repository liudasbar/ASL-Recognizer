## Features and Datasets

The application uses __American Sign Language (ASL)__ ML recognition model that is was organized, trained, and tested via Xcode Create ML tools.

While the developer does not provide any related data sets, it is worth mentioning that the data set for this specific application consists of images (that were used for training and validation of an aforementioned ML model) gathered from various sources found on the internet varying from ASL learning YouTube videos to publicly available ASL hand poses images data sets.

## What can be recognized?

ASL Recognizer detects only alphabet letters A-Z and numbers from 0-9. Hand pose detection output is shown within the main application interface. Each detected symbol (letter or number) is added to the current value with previously detected symbols.

## Abbreviations

ASL - American Sign Language

ML - Machine Learning

## Availability

The project is written on Xcode 13 for iOS/iPadOS devices from iOS 14.

## Recognition model

Accuracy:
* Training - 96 %
* Validation - 88 %

Training data:
* 36 classes
* 11 128 items

## Privacy permissions

User needs to grant these privacy permissions:
* Camera - Used for detecting and recognizing hand poses.

## Offline

ASL Recognizer is fully offline. Thus, no data is being sent or received to and from any server. Data collection is not implemented in any way.
